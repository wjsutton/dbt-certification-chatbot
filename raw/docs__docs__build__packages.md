# Packages

Software engineers frequently modularize code into libraries. These libraries help programmers operate with leverage: they can spend more time focusing on their unique business logic, and less time implementing code that someone else has already spent the time perfecting.

In dbt, libraries like these are called *packages*. dbt's packages are so powerful because so many of the analytic problems we encountered are shared across organizations, for example:

* transforming data from a consistently structured SaaS dataset, for example:

  * turning [Snowplow](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/snowplow/latest/) or [Segment](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/segment/latest/) pageviews into sessions
  * transforming [AdWords](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/adwords/latest/) or [Facebook Ads](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/facebook_ads/latest/) spend data into a consistent format.

* writing dbt macros that perform similar functions, for example:

  * [generating SQL](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils#sql-helpers) to union together two relations, pivot columns, or construct a surrogate key
  * creating [custom schema tests](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils#schema-tests)
  * writing [audit queries](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/audit_helper/latest/)

* building models and macros for a particular tool used in your data stack, for example:

  * Models to understand [Redshift](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/redshift/latest/) privileges.
  * Macros to work with data loaded by [Stitch](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/stitch_utils/latest/).

dbt *packages* are in fact standalone dbt projects, with models, macros, and other resources that tackle a specific problem area. As a dbt user, by adding a package to your project, all of the package's resources will become part of your own project. This means:

* Models in the package will be materialized when you `dbt run`.
* You can use `ref` in your own models to refer to models from the package.
* You can use `source` to refer to sources in the package.
* You can use macros in the package in your own project.
* It's important to note that defining and installing dbt packages is different from [defining and installing Python packages](./python-models.md#using-pypi-packages)

## Use cases

The following setup will work for every dbt project:

* Add [any package dependencies](../mesh/govern/project-dependencies.md#when-to-use-project-dependencies) to `packages.yml`
* Add [any project dependencies](../mesh/govern/project-dependencies.md#when-to-use-package-dependencies) to `dependencies.yml`

However, you may be able to consolidate both into a single `dependencies.yml` file. Read the following section to learn more.

#### About packages.yml and dependencies.yml

The `dependencies.yml`. file can contain both types of dependencies: "package" and "project" dependencies.

* [Package dependencies](./packages.md#how-do-i-add-a-package-to-my-project) lets you add source code from someone else's dbt project into your own, like a library.
* Project dependencies provide a different way to build on top of someone else's work in dbt.
* Private packages are not supported in `dependencies.yml` because they intentionally don't support Jinja rendering or conditional configuration. This is to maintain static and predictable configuration and ensures compatibility with other services, like dbt.

If your dbt project doesn't require the use of Jinja within the package specifications, you can simply rename your existing `packages.yml` to `dependencies.yml`. However, something to note is if your project's package specifications use Jinja, particularly for scenarios like adding an environment variable or a [Git token method](./packages.md#git-token-method) in a private Git package specification, you should continue using the `packages.yml` file name.

Use the following toggles to understand the differences and determine when to use `dependencies.yml` or `packages.yml` (or both). Refer to the [FAQs](#faqs) for more info.

 When to use Project dependencies

Project dependencies are designed for the [dbt Mesh](../../best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-1-intro.md) and [cross-project reference](../mesh/govern/project-dependencies.md#how-to-write-cross-project-ref) workflow:

* Use `dependencies.yml` when you need to set up cross-project references between different dbt projects, especially in a dbt Mesh setup.
* Use `dependencies.yml` when you want to include both projects and non-private dbt packages in your project's dependencies.
* Use `dependencies.yml` for organization and maintainability if you're using both [cross-project refs](../mesh/govern/project-dependencies.md#how-to-write-cross-project-ref) and [dbt Hub packages](https://hub.getdbt.com/). This reduces the need for multiple YAML files to manage dependencies.

 When to use Package dependencies

Package dependencies allow you to add source code from someone else's dbt project into your own, like a library:

* If you only use packages like those from the [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/), remain with `packages.yml`.
* Use `packages.yml` when you want to download dbt packages, such as dbt projects, into your root or parent dbt project. Something to note is that it doesn't contribute to the dbt Mesh workflow.
* Use `packages.yml` to include packages in your project's dependencies. This includes both public packages, such as those from the [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/), and private packages. dbt now supports [native private packages](./packages.md#native-private-packages).
* [`packages.yml` supports Jinja rendering](./dbt-tips.md#yaml-tips) for historical reasons, allowing dynamic configurations. This can be useful if you need to insert values, like a [Git token method](./packages.md#git-token-method) from an environment variable, into your package specifications.

Previously, to use private Git repositories in dbt, you needed to use a workaround that involved embedding a Git token with Jinja. This is not ideal as it requires extra steps like creating a user and sharing a Git token. We’ve introduced support for [native private packages](./packages.md#native-private-packages-) to address this.

## How do I create a package?

Creating packages is an advanced use of dbt, but it can be a relatively simple task. The only strict requirement is the presence of a [`dbt_project.yml` file](../../reference/dbt_project.yml.md).

The most common use-cases for packages are:

* Sharing [models](./models.md) to share across multiple projects.
* Sharing [macros](./jinja-macros.md) to share across multiple projects.

Note that packages can be [private](#private-packages) — they don't need to be shared publicly. Private packages can be hosted on your own Git provider (for example, GitHub or GitLab).

For instructions on creating dbt packages and additional information, refer to our guide [Building dbt packages](../../guides/building-packages.md?step=1).

## How do I add a package to my project?

1. Add a file named `dependencies.yml` or `packages.yml` to your dbt project. This should be at the same level as your `dbt_project.yml` file.
2. Specify the package(s) you wish to add using one of the supported syntaxes, for example:

```yaml
packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/snowplow
    version: 0.7.0

  - git: "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils.git"
    revision: 0.9.2

  - local: /opt/dbt/redshift
```

The default [`packages-install-path`](../../reference/project-configs/packages-install-path.md) is `dbt_packages`.

3. Run `dbt deps` to install the package(s). Packages get installed in the `dbt_packages` directory – by default this directory is ignored by git, to avoid duplicating the source code for the package.

## How do I specify a package?

You can specify a package using one of the following methods, depending on where your package is stored.

### Hub packages (recommended)

dbt Labs hosts the [Package hub](https://hub.getdbt.com), registry for dbt packages, as a courtesy to the dbt Community, but does not certify or confirm the integrity, operability, effectiveness, or security of any Packages. Please read the [dbt Labs Package Disclaimer](https://hub.getdbt.com/disclaimer/) before installing Hub packages.

You can install available hub packages in the following way:

packages.yml

```yaml
packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/snowplow
    version: 0.7.3 # version number
```

Hub packages require a version to be specified – you can find the latest release number on dbt Hub. Since Hub packages use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), we recommend pinning your package to the latest patch version from a specific minor release, like so:

```yaml
packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/snowplow
    version: [">=0.7.0", "<0.8.0"]
```

`dbt deps` "pins" each package by default. See ["Pinning packages"](#pinning-packages) for details.

Where possible, we recommend installing packages via dbt Hub, since this allows dbt to handle duplicate dependencies. This is helpful in situations such as:

* Your project uses both the dbt-utils and Snowplow packages, and the Snowplow package *also* uses the dbt-utils package.
* Your project uses both the Snowplow and Stripe packages, both of which use the dbt-utils package.

In comparison, other package installation methods are unable to handle the duplicate dbt-utils package.

Advanced users can choose to host an internal version of the package hub based on [this repository](https://github.com/dbt-labs/hub.getdbt.com) and setting the (Applies to dbt v1.11 and later) `DBT_ENGINE_PACKAGE_HUB_URL` environment variable.

#### Prerelease versions

Some package maintainers may wish to push prerelease versions of packages to the dbt Hub, in order to test out new functionality or compatibility with a new version of dbt. A prerelease version is demarcated by a suffix, such as `a1` (first alpha), `b2` (second beta), or `rc3` (third release candidate).

By default, `dbt deps` will not include prerelease versions when resolving package dependencies. You can enable the installation of prereleases in one of two ways:

* Explicitly specifying a prerelease version in your `version` criteria
* Setting `install_prerelease` to `true`, and providing a compatible version range

For example, both of the following configurations would successfully install `0.4.5-a2` for the [`dbt_artifacts` package](https://hub.getdbt.com/brooklyn-data/dbt_artifacts/latest/):

```yaml
packages:
  - package: brooklyn-data/dbt_artifacts
    version: 0.4.5-a2
```

```yaml
packages:
  - package: brooklyn-data/dbt_artifacts
    version: [">=0.4.4", "<0.4.6"]
    install_prerelease: true
```

### Git packages

Packages stored on a Git server can be installed using the `git` syntax, like so:

packages.yml

```yaml
packages:
  - git: "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils.git" # git URL
    revision: 0.9.2 # tag or branch name
```

Add the Git URL for the package, and optionally specify a revision. The revision can be:

* a branch name
* a tagged release
* a specific commit (full 40-character hash)

Example of a revision specifying a 40-character hash:

```yaml
packages:
  - git: "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils.git"
    revision: 4e28d6da126e2940d17f697de783a717f2503188
```

By default, `dbt deps` "pins" each package. See ["Pinning packages"](#pinning-packages) for details.

### Internally hosted tarball URL

Some organizations have security requirements to pull resources only from internal services. To address the need to install packages from hosted environments such as Artifactory or cloud storage buckets, dbt Core enables you to install packages from internally-hosted tarball URLs.

```yaml
packages:
  - tarball: https://codeload.github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/tar.gz/0.9.6
    name: 'dbt_utils'
```

Where `name: 'dbt_utils'` specifies the subfolder of `dbt_packages` that's created for the package source code to be installed within.

## Private packages

### Native private packages

Native private packages let you install packages from [supported](#prerequisites) private Git repos using the `private` key, without having to configure a [token](#git-token-method) or write out a full Git URL. This simplifies setup and reduces credential management.

* dbt platform: Uses your existing Git [integration](../platform/git/configure-git.md) for authentication.
* Locally using Fusion or dbt Core v1.12+: Uses your system's SSH configuration. Requires the [`provider` key](#using-the-provider-key).

#### Prerequisites

* **dbt platform**: You must have one of the following Git providers configured in the **Integrations** section of your **Account settings**:

  * **[GitHub](../platform/git/connect-github.md)**
  * **[Azure DevOps](../platform/git/connect-azure-devops.md)**
    * Use the `org/project/repo` path with the `ado` provider.
  * **[GitLab](../platform/git/connect-gitlab.md)**
    * Every GitLab repo with private packages must also be a dbt platform project.

* **Locally using Fusion or dbt Core v1.12+**: You must have an SSH key configured on your machine for the relevant Git provider and include the [`provider` key](#using-the-provider-key) in your package configuration.

#### Configuration

Use the `private` key in your `packages.yml` or `dependencies.yml` to clone package repos using your existing dbt Git integration without having to provision an access token or create a dbt environment variable.

packages.yml

```yaml
packages:
  - private: dbt-labs/awesome_repo # your-org/your-repo path
    provider: "github" # Supported values: "github", "gitlab", "ado"
  - package: normal packages
  [...]
```

dependencies.yml

```yaml
packages:
  - private: dbt-labs/awesome_repo # your-org/your-repo path
    provider: "github" # Supported values: "github", "gitlab", "ado"
```

Azure DevOps considerations and limitations

There are some considerations and limitations when using native private packages from Azure DevOps. Open the expandable section to learn more.

 Native private packages and Azure DevOps limitations

1. Use the `ado` provider and specify the `org/project/repo` path in the `private` key.

   packages.yml

   ```yaml
   packages:
     - private: my-org/my-project/my-repo
       provider: "ado"
   ```

2. On dbt platform, native private packages from Azure DevOps can fail when the package is in a different Azure DevOps project than the job that installs it, especially if your account is connected to many Azure DevOps projects:

   * This happens because dbt platform has a 32 KB limit for the Azure DevOps authentication details it can use at job runtime. If your connected Azure DevOps projects exceed that limit, dbt platform can only use the current project's connection. As a result, packages in other Azure DevOps projects can't be accessed and `dbt deps` fails.

   * As a workaround, reduce the number of Azure DevOps projects connected to your account, then rerun `dbt deps`. The number of projects you can connect depends on your Azure DevOps organization structure and repo count.

   This limitation doesn't affect local development with dbt Core or Fusion when cloning private packages over SSH.

   We're currently working to address this, and if you're running into issues, please contact your dbt Labs account team.

You can pin private packages similar to regular dbt packages:

```yaml
packages:
  - private: dbt-labs/awesome_repo
    revision: "0.9.5" # Pin to a tag, branch, or complete 40-character commit hash
  
```

#### Using the `provider` key

Add the `provider` key when:

* You are using multiple Git integrations or using the dbt Fusion engine.
* You are using Fusion locally (with the [Fusion CLI](../local/install-dbt.md?version=2) or the [VS Code extension](../local/install-dbt.md?version=2)) (required).
* You are using dbt Core v1.12 or later for SSH-based cloning (required).

```yaml
packages:
  - private: dbt-labs/awesome_repo
    provider: "github" # Supported values: "github", "gitlab", "ado"
```

dbt Core and Fusion use the `provider` value to construct the correct SSH URL for cloning, based on the provider:

| Provider | SSH URL format                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `github` | `git@github.com:org/repo.git`               |
| `gitlab` | `git@gitlab.com:org/repo.git`               |
| `ado`    | `git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/org/project/repo` |

dbt Core and Fusion rely on your system's SSH configuration to authenticate and clone the private repository. If `git clone` works on your system for the private package repo, the private package install should work too.

### SSH key method (CLI only)

note

This method uses the `git:` key with a full SSH URL, which is different from [native private packages](#native-private-packages) that use the `private:` key. For most use cases, native private packages is the recommended approach as it simplifies setup.

If you're using the Command Line, private packages can be cloned via SSH and an SSH key.

When you use SSH keys to authenticate to your git remote server, you don’t need to supply your username and password each time. Read more about SSH keys, how to generate them, and how to add them to your git provider here: [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) and [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ssh.html).

packages.yml

```yaml
packages:
  - git: "git@github.com:dbt-labs/dbt-utils.git" # git SSH URL
```

If you're using the dbt platform, the SSH key method will not work, but you can use [native private packages](#native-private-packages) or the [HTTPS Git Token Method](./packages.md#git-token-method).

### Git token method

note

[Native private packages](#native-private-packages) is the recommended approach for GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. The git token method is still functional in dbt Core, Fusion, and the dbt platform, but requires provisioning a personal access token. It remains the supported path for dbt Core users who need HTTPS-based cloning.

This method allows the user to clone via HTTPS by passing in a git token via an environment variable. Be careful of the expiration date of any token you use, as an expired token could cause a scheduled run to fail. Additionally, user tokens can create a challenge if the user ever loses access to a specific repo.

dbt usage

If you are using dbt, you must adhere to the naming conventions for environment variables. Environment variables in dbt must be prefixed with either `DBT_` or `DBT_ENV_SECRET`. Environment variables keys are uppercased and case sensitive. When referencing `{{env_var('DBT_KEY')}}` in your project's code, the key must match exactly the variable defined in dbt's UI.

In GitHub:

packages.yml

```yaml
packages:
  # use this format when accessing your repository via a github application token
  - git: "https://{{env_var('DBT_ENV_SECRET_GIT_CREDENTIAL')}}@github.com/dbt-labs/awesome_repo.git" # git HTTPS URL

  # use this format when accessing your repository via a classical personal access token
  - git: "https://{{env_var('DBT_ENV_SECRET_GIT_CREDENTIAL')}}@github.com/dbt-labs/awesome_repo.git" # git HTTPS URL
 
   # use this format when accessing your repository via a fine-grained personal access token (username sometimes required)
  - git: "https://GITHUB_USERNAME:{{env_var('DBT_ENV_SECRET_GIT_CREDENTIAL')}}@github.com/dbt-labs/awesome_repo.git" # git HTTPS URL
```

Read more about creating a GitHub Personal Access token [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.1/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). You can also use a GitHub App installation [token](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/apps#create-an-installation-access-token-for-an-app).

In GitLab:

packages.yml

```yaml
packages:
  - git: "https://{{env_var('DBT_USER_NAME')}}:{{env_var('DBT_ENV_SECRET_DEPLOY_TOKEN')}}@gitlab.example.com/dbt-labs/awesome_project.git" # git HTTPS URL
```

Read more about creating a GitLab Deploy Token [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_tokens/#creating-a-deploy-token) and how to properly construct your HTTPS URL [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_tokens/#git-clone-a-repository). Deploy tokens can be managed by Maintainers only.

In Azure DevOps:

packages.yml

```yaml
packages:
  - git: "https://{{env_var('DBT_ENV_SECRET_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN')}}@dev.azure.com/dbt-labs/awesome_project/_git/awesome_repo" # git HTTPS URL
```

Read more about creating a Personal Access Token [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops\&tabs=preview-page#create-a-pat).

In Bitbucket:

packages.yml

```yaml
packages:
  - git: "https://{{env_var('DBT_USER_NAME')}}:{{env_var('DBT_ENV_SECRET_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN')}}@bitbucketserver.com/scm/awesome_project/awesome_repo.git" # for Bitbucket Server
```

Read more about creating a Personal Access Token [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/personal-access-tokens-939515499.html).

## Configure subdirectory for packaged projects

In general, dbt expects `dbt_project.yml` to be located as a top-level file in a package. If the packaged project is instead nested in a subdirectory—perhaps within a much larger mono repo—you can optionally specify the folder path as `subdirectory`. dbt will attempt a [sparse checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout) of just the files located within that subdirectory. Note that you must be using a recent version of `git` (`>=2.26.0`).

packages.yml

```yaml
packages:
  - git: "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-labs-experimental-features" # git URL
    subdirectory: "materialized-views" # name of subdirectory containing `dbt_project.yml`
```

### Local packages

A "local" package is a dbt project accessible from your local file system. They're best suited for when there is a common collection of models and macros that you want to share across multiple downstream dbt projects (but each downstream project still has its own unique models, macros, etc).

You can install local packages by specifying the project's path. It works best when you nest the project within a subdirectory relative to your current project's directory.

packages.yml

```yaml
packages:
  - local: relative/path/to/subdirectory
```

Other patterns may work in some cases, but not always. For example, if you install this project as a package elsewhere, or try running it on a different system, the relative and absolute paths will yield the same results.

packages.yml

```yaml
packages:
  # not recommended - support for these patterns vary
  - local: /../../redshift   # relative path to a parent directory
  - local: /opt/dbt/redshift # absolute path on the system
```

There are a few specific use cases where we recommend using a "local" package:

1. **Monorepo** — When you have multiple projects, each nested in a subdirectory, within a monorepo. "Local" packages allow you to combine projects for coordinated development and deployment.
2. **Testing changes** — To test changes in one project or package within the context of a downstream project or package that uses it. By temporarily switching the installation to a "local" package, you can make changes to the former and immediately test them in the latter for quicker iteration. This is similar to [editable installs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/) in Python.
3. **Nested project** — When you have a nested project that defines fixtures and tests for a project of utility macros, like [the integration tests within the `dbt-utils` package](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/tree/main/integration_tests).

## What packages are available?

To see the library of published dbt packages, check out the [dbt package hub](https://hub.getdbt.com)!

## Fusion package compatibility

To determine if a package is compatible with dbt v2, visit the [dbt package hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) and look for the Fusion-compatible badge, or review the package's [`require-dbt-version` configuration](../../reference/project-configs/require-dbt-version.md#pin-to-a-range).

* Packages with a `require-dbt-version` that equals or contains `2.0.0` are compatible with dbt v2. For example, `require-dbt-version: ">=1.10.0,<3.0.0"`.

  Even if a package doesn't reflect compatibility in the package hub, it may still work with v2. Work with package maintainers to track updates, and [thoroughly test packages](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/dbt-package-compat?step=5) that aren't clearly compatible before deploying.

* Package maintainers who would like to make their package compatible with v2 can refer to the [dbt v2 package upgrade guide](../../guides/dbt-package-compat.md) for instructions.

Fivetran package considerations:

* The Fivetran `source` and `transformation` packages have been combined into a single package.
* If you manually installed source packages like `fivetran/github_source`, you need to ensure `fivetran/github` is installed and deactivate the transformation models.

#### Package compatibility messages

Inconsistent v2 warnings and `dbt-autofix` logs

dbt v2 warnings and `dbt-autofix` logs may show different messages about package compatibility.

If you use [`dbt-autofix`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-autofix) while upgrading to v2 in the Studio IDE or dbt VS Code extension, you may see different messages about package compatibility between `dbt-autofix` and v2 warnings.

Here's why:

* dbt v2 warnings are emitted based on a package's `require-dbt-version` and whether `require-dbt-version` contains `2.0.0`.
* Some packages are already v2-compatible even though package maintainers haven't yet updated `require-dbt-version`.
* `dbt-autofix` knows about these compatible packages and will not try to upgrade a package that it knows is already compatible.

This means that even if you see a v2 warning for a package that `dbt-autofix` identifies as compatible, you don't need to change the package.

The message discrepancy is temporary while we implement and roll out `dbt-autofix`'s enhanced compatibility detection to v2 warnings.

Here's an example of a dbt v2 warning in the Studio IDE that says a package isn't compatible with v2 but `dbt-autofix` indicates it is compatible:

```text
dbt1065: Package 'dbt_utils' requires dbt version [>=1.30,<2.0.0], but current version is 2.0.0-preview.72. This package may not be compatible with your dbt version. dbt(1065) [Ln 1, Col 1]
```

## Advanced package configuration

### Updating a package

When you update a version or revision in your `packages.yml` file, it isn't automatically updated in your dbt project. You should run `dbt deps` to update the package. You may also need to run a [full refresh](../../reference/commands/run.md) of the models in this package.

### Uninstalling a package

When you remove a package from your `packages.yml` file, it isn't automatically deleted from your dbt project, as it still exists in your `dbt_packages/` directory. If you want to completely uninstall a package, you should either:

* delete the package directory in `dbt_packages/`; or
* run `dbt clean` to delete *all* packages (and any compiled models), followed by `dbt deps`.

### Pinning packages

Running [`dbt deps`](../../reference/commands/deps.md) "pins" each package by creating or updating the `package-lock.yml` file in the *project\_root* where `packages.yml` is recorded.

* The `package-lock.yml` file contains a record of all packages installed.
* If subsequent `dbt deps` runs contain no changes to `dependencies.yml` or `packages.yml`, dbt-core installs from `package-lock.yml`.

For example, if you use a branch name, the `package-lock.yml` file pins to the head commit. If you use a version range, it pins to the latest release. In either case, subsequent commits or versions will **not** be installed. To get new commits or versions, run `dbt deps --upgrade` or add `package-lock.yml` to your .gitignore file.

dbt will warn you if you install a package using the `git` syntax without specifying a revision (see below).

### Configuring packages

You can configure the models and seeds in a package from the `dbt_project.yml` file, like so:

dbt\_project.yml

```yml

vars:
  snowplow:
    'snowplow:timezone': 'America/New_York'
    'snowplow:page_ping_frequency': 10
    'snowplow:events': "{{ ref('sp_base_events') }}"
    'snowplow:context:web_page': "{{ ref('sp_base_web_page_context') }}"
    'snowplow:context:performance_timing': false
    'snowplow:context:useragent': false
    'snowplow:pass_through_columns': []

models:
  snowplow:
    +schema: snowplow

seeds:
  snowplow:
    +schema: snowplow_seeds
```

For example, when using a dataset specific package, you may need to configure variables for the names of the tables that contain your raw data.

Configurations made in your project YAML file (`dbt_project.yml`) will override any configurations in a package (either in the project YAML file of the package, or in config blocks).

### Specifying unpinned Git packages

If your project specifies an "unpinned" Git package, you may see a warning like:

```text
The git package "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils.git" is not pinned.
This can introduce breaking changes into your project without warning!
```

This warning can be silenced by setting `warn-unpinned: false` in the package specification. **Note:** This is not recommended.

packages.yml

```yaml
packages:
  - git: https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils.git
    warn-unpinned: false
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors while working with dbt packages, see the following FAQs:

Why am I receiving a Runtime Error in my packages?

If you're receiving the runtime error below in your packages.yml folder, it may be due to an old version of your dbt\_utils package that isn't compatible with your current dbt version.

```shell
Running with dbt=xxx
Runtime Error
  Failed to read package: Runtime Error
    Invalid config version: 1, expected 2  
  Error encountered in dbt_utils/dbt_project.yml
```

Try updating the old version of the dbt\_utils package in your packages.yml to the latest version found in the [dbt hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/dbt_utils/latest/):

```shell
packages:
- package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils

version: xxx
```

\[Error] Could not find my\_project package

If a package name is included in the `search_order` of a project-level `dispatch` config, dbt expects that package to contain macros which are viable candidates for dispatching. If an included package does not contain *any* macros, dbt will raise an error like:

```shell
Compilation Error
  In dispatch: Could not find package 'my_project'
```

This does not mean the package or root project is missing—it means that any macros from it are missing, and so it is missing from the search spaces available to `dispatch`.
