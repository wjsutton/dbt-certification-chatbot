# Add sources to your DAG

## Related reference docs

* [Source properties](../../reference/source-properties.md)
* [Source configurations](../../reference/source-configs.md)
* [`{{ source() }}` Jinja function](../../reference/dbt-jinja-functions/source.md)
* [`source freshness` command](../../reference/commands/source.md)

## Using sources

Sources make it possible to name and describe the data loaded into your warehouse by your Extract and Load tools. By declaring these tables as sources in dbt, you can then

* select from source tables in your models using the [`{{ source() }}` function,](../../reference/dbt-jinja-functions/source.md) helping define the lineage of your data
* test your assumptions about your source data
* calculate the freshness of your source data

### Declaring a source

Sources are defined in `.yml` files nested under a `sources:` key.

models/\<filename>.yml

```yaml

sources:
  - name: jaffle_shop
    database: raw  
    schema: jaffle_shop  
    tables:
      - name: orders
      - name: customers

  - name: stripe
    tables:
      - name: payments
```

\*By default, `schema` will be the same as `name`. Add `schema` only if you want to use a source name that differs from the existing schema.

If you're not already familiar with these files, be sure to check out [the documentation on properties.yml files](../../reference/configs-and-properties.md) before proceeding.

### Selecting from a source

Once a source has been defined, it can be referenced from a model using the [`{{ source()}}` function](../../reference/dbt-jinja-functions/source.md).

models/orders.sql

```sql
select
  ...

from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'orders') }}

left join {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'customers') }} using (customer_id)
```

dbt will compile this to the full table name:

target/compiled/jaffle\_shop/models/my\_model.sql

```sql

select
  ...

from raw.jaffle_shop.orders

left join raw.jaffle_shop.customers using (customer_id)
```

Using the `{{ source () }}` function also creates a dependency between the model and the source table.

[![The source function tells dbt a model is dependent on a source ](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/building-a-dbt-project/sources-dag.png?v=2 "The source function tells dbt a model is dependent on a source ")](#)The source function tells dbt a model is dependent on a source

### Testing and documenting sources

You can also:

* Add data tests to sources
* Add descriptions to sources, that get rendered as part of your documentation site

These should be familiar concepts if you've already added data tests and descriptions to your models (if not check out the guides on [testing](./data-tests.md) and [documentation](./documentation.md)).

models/\<filename>.yml

```yaml

sources:
  - name: jaffle_shop
    description: This is a replica of the Postgres database used by our app
    tables:
      - name: orders
        database: raw
        description: >
          One record per order. Includes cancelled and deleted orders.
        columns:
          - name: id
            description: Primary key of the orders table
            data_tests:
              - unique
              - not_null
          - name: status
            description: Note that the status can change over time

      - name: ...

  - name: ...
```

You can find more details on the available properties for sources in the [reference section](../../reference/source-properties.md).

### FAQs

What if my source is in a poorly named schema or table?

By default, dbt will use the `name:` parameters to construct the source reference.

If these names are a little less-than-perfect, use the [schema](../../reference/resource-properties/schema.md) and [identifier](../../reference/resource-properties/identifier.md) properties to define the names as per the database, and use your `name:` property for the name that makes sense!

models/\<filename>.yml

```yml
sources:
  - name: jaffle_shop
    database: raw
    schema: postgres_backend_public_schema
    tables:
      - name: orders
        identifier: api_orders
```

In a downstream model:

```sql
select * from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'orders') }}
```

Will get compiled to:

```sql
select * from raw.postgres_backend_public_schema.api_orders
```

What if my source is in a different database to my target database?

Use the [`database` property](../../reference/resource-properties/database.md) to define the database that the source is in.

models/\<filename>.yml

```yml
sources:
  - name: jaffle_shop
    database: raw
    schema: jaffle_shop
    tables:
      - name: orders
      - name: customers
```

I need to use quotes to select from my source, what should I do?

This is reasonably common on Snowflake in particular.

By default, dbt will not quote the database, schema, or identifier for the source tables that you've specified.

To force dbt to quote one of these values, use the [`quoting` property](../../reference/resource-properties/quoting.md):

models/\<filename>.yml

```yaml
sources:
  - name: jaffle_shop
    database: raw
    schema: jaffle_shop
    quoting:
      database: true
      schema: true
      identifier: true

    tables:
      - name: order_items
      - name: orders
        # This overrides the `jaffle_shop` quoting config
        quoting:
          identifier: false
```

How do I run data tests on just my sources?

To run data tests on all sources, use the following command:

```shell
  dbt test --select "source:*"
```

(You can also use the `-s` shorthand here instead of `--select`)

To run data tests on one source (and all of its tables):

```shell
$ dbt test --select source:jaffle_shop
```

And, to run data tests on one source table only:

```shell
$ dbt test --select source:jaffle_shop.orders
```

How do I run models downstream of one source?

To run models downstream of a source, use the `source:` selector:

```shell
$ dbt run --select source:jaffle_shop+
```

(You can also use the `-s` shorthand here instead of `--select`)

To run models downstream of one source table:

```shell
$ dbt run --select source:jaffle_shop.orders+
```

Check out the [model selection syntax](../../reference/node-selection/syntax.md) for more examples!

## Source data freshness

With a couple of extra configs, dbt can optionally capture the "freshness" of the data in your source tables. This is useful for understanding if your data pipelines are in a healthy state, and is a critical component of defining Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for your warehouse.

### Fusion and dbt State

State-aware orchestration is now dbt State

[dbt State](../deploy/dbt-state-about.md) works with all engines and environments: dbt Core, dbt platform, and Fusion

If you were using state-aware orchestration prior to June 1, 2026, you can continue using it. Once you start your free dbt State trial, it will be extended beyond the standard 30-day period. If the extension isn't applied to your account, contact your account team. To get started, refer to [Migrate from state-aware orchestration](../deploy/dbt-state-migration.md).

If you're using the dbt Fusion engine with [state-aware orchestration](../deploy/state-aware-about.md), dbt automatically tracks source freshness using warehouse metadata. You don't need to configure `warn_after` or `error_after` for dbt to detect when source data changes.

If you're using [dbt State](../deploy/dbt-state-about.md), use [`lag_tolerance`](../../reference/resource-configs/lag-tolerance.md) to control how frequently models rebuild based on upstream data changes. You can also configure `loaded_at_field` or `loaded_at_query` on your source for more accurate freshness detection (for example, for streaming data or late-arriving records).

However, you should still configure source freshness if you want to:

* Receive SLA alerts when sources don't update within expected timeframes.
* Define custom freshness logic using `loaded_at_field` or `loaded_at_query` (for example, for streaming data or partial loads).
* Track freshness for source views. Fusion treats views as "always fresh" since it can't determine freshness from view metadata.

### Declaring source freshness

To configure source freshness information, add a `freshness` block to your source and `loaded_at_field` to your table declaration:

models/\<filename>.yml

```yaml

sources:
  - name: jaffle_shop
    database: raw
    config: 
      freshness: # default freshness
        # changed to config in v1.9
        warn_after: {count: 12, period: hour}
        error_after: {count: 24, period: hour}
      loaded_at_field: _etl_loaded_at # changed to config in v1.10

    tables:
      - name: orders
        config:
          freshness: # make this a little more strict
            warn_after: {count: 6, period: hour}
            error_after: {count: 12, period: hour}

      - name: customers # this inherits the default freshness defined in the jaffle_shop source block at the beginning

      - name: product_skus
        config:
          freshness: null # do not check freshness for this table
```

In the `freshness` block, one or both of `warn_after` and `error_after` can be provided. If neither is provided, then dbt will not calculate freshness for the tables in this source.

Additionally, the `loaded_at_field` is required to calculate freshness for a table (except for cases where dbt can leverage warehouse metadata to calculate freshness). If a `loaded_at_field`, or viable alternative, is not provided, then dbt will not calculate freshness for the table.

These configs are applied hierarchically, so `freshness` and `loaded_at_field` values specified for a `source` will flow through to all of the `tables` defined in that source. This is useful when all of the tables in a source have the same `loaded_at_field`, as the config can just be specified once in the top-level source definition.

### Checking source freshness

To obtain freshness information for your sources, use the `dbt source freshness` command ([reference docs](../../reference/commands/source.md)):

```text
$ dbt source freshness
```

Behind the scenes, dbt uses the freshness properties to construct a `select` query, shown below. You can find this query in the [query logs](../../faqs/Runs/checking-logs.md).

```sql
select
  max(_etl_loaded_at) as max_loaded_at,
  convert_timezone('UTC', current_timestamp()) as calculated_at
from raw.jaffle_shop.orders
```

The results of this query are used to determine whether the source is fresh or not:

[![Uh oh! Not everything is as fresh as we'd like!](https://docs.getdbt.com/img/docs/building-a-dbt-project/snapshot-freshness.png?v=2 "Uh oh! Not everything is as fresh as we'd like!")](#)Uh oh! Not everything is as fresh as we'd like!

### Build models based on source freshness

Our best practice recommendation is to use [data source freshness](./sources.md#declaring-source-freshness). This will allow settings to be transfered into a `.yml` file where source freshness is defined on [model level](../../reference/resource-properties/freshness.md).

To build models based on source freshness in dbt:

1. Run `dbt source freshness` to check the freshness of your sources.
2. Use the `dbt build --select source_status:fresher+` command to build and test models downstream of fresher sources.

Using these commands in order makes sure models update with the latest data. This eliminates wasted compute cycles on unchanged data and builds models *only* when necessary.

Set [source freshness checks](../deploy/source-freshness.md#enabling-source-freshness-checks) to 30 minutes, then run a job which rebuilds every hour. This setup retrieves all the models and rebuilds them in one attempt if their source freshness has expired. For more information, refer to [Source freshness check frequency](../deploy/source-freshness.md#source-freshness-check-frequency).

### Filter

Some databases can have tables where a filter over certain columns are required, in order prevent a full scan of the table, which could be costly. In order to do a freshness check on such tables a `filter` argument can be added to the configuration, for example, `filter: _etl_loaded_at >= date_sub(current_date(), interval 1 day)`. For the example above, the resulting query would look like

```sql
select
  max(_etl_loaded_at) as max_loaded_at,
  convert_timezone('UTC', current_timestamp()) as calculated_at
from raw.jaffle_shop.orders
where _etl_loaded_at >= date_sub(current_date(), interval 1 day)
```

### FAQs

How do I exclude a table from a freshness snapshot?

Some tables in a data source may be updated infrequently. If you've set a `freshness` property at the source level, this table is likely to fail checks.

To work around this, you can set the table's freshness to null (`freshness: null`) to "unset" the freshness for a particular table:

models/\<filename>.yml

```yaml
sources:
  - name: jaffle_shop
    database: raw
    schema: jaffle_shop
    config: 
      freshness:
        warn_after: {count: 12, period: hour}
        error_after: {count: 24, period: hour}
      loaded_at_field: _etl_loaded_at

    tables:
      - name: orders
      - name: product_skus
        config:
          freshness: null # do not check freshness for this table
```

How do I snapshot freshness for one source only?

Use the `--select` flag to snapshot freshness for specific sources. Eg:

```shell
# Snapshot freshness for all Jaffle Shop tables:
$ dbt source freshness --select source:jaffle_shop

# Snapshot freshness for a particular source table:
$ dbt source freshness --select source:jaffle_shop.orders

# Snapshot freshness for multiple particular source tables:
$ dbt source freshness --select source:jaffle_shop.orders source:jaffle_shop.customers
```

See the [`source freshness` command reference](../../reference/commands/source.md) for more information.

Are the results of freshness stored anywhere?

Yes!

The `dbt source freshness` command will output a pass/warning/error status for each table selected in the freshness snapshot.

Additionally, dbt will write the freshness results to a file in the `target/` directory called `sources.json` by default. You can also override this destination, use the `-o` flag to the `dbt source freshness` command.

After enabling source freshness within a job, configure [Artifacts](../deploy/artifacts.md) in your **Project Details** page, which you can find by selecting your account name on the left side menu in dbt and clicking **Account settings**. You can see the current status for source freshness by clicking **View Sources** in the job page.
